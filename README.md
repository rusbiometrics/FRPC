# Face Recognition Performance Check
The Face Recognition Performance Check (FRPC) seeks to identify which algorithms are most accurate at recognizing faces in images collected in an unconstrained manner.

Here you can find:
 
 - nullImpl - dummy example of verification API interface implementation
 
 - frpc.h - header that should be used as reference for verification API interface implementation
